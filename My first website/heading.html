<p>In 1980, physicist <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and <em>prototyped ENQUIRE</em>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. </p>
<p>In his personal notes of 1990, <small>Berners-Lee</small> listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</p>
